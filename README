# MyProjects

Welcome to **MyProjects** — a personal collection of small programs and practice projects written in **C**, **C++**, and **Python**. This repository showcases my journey through programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and algorithm design. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different concepts, such as file I/O, data structures, sorting algorithms, and user interaction via the command line.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories based on programming language and/or project focus. Here's an overview:

### 🔹 C Projects

* Fundamental programs showcasing pointers, file handling, loops, and arrays.
* Example: File reading/writing, basic games, simple utilities.

### 🔹 C++ Projects

* Object-oriented implementations and algorithmic exercises.
* Example: Sorting algorithms, class-based designs, simulations.

### 🔹 Python Projects

* General-purpose scripting and exercises.
* Includes both standard Python and PEP8-compliant code.
* Example: Data parsing, command-line tools, automation scripts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Languages**: C, C++, Python (PEP8 style and standard Python)
* **Tools**: GCC, g++, Python 3, Makefiles (where applicable)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the projects locally:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KurtJJensen01/MyProjects.git
   cd MyProjects
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder**

   ```bash
   cd C/SomeProject
   ```

3. **Compile and run (for C/C++)**

   ```bash
   gcc program.c -o program
   ./program
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   g++ program.cpp -o program
   ./program
   ```

4. **Run Python scripts**

   ```bash
   python3 script.py
   ```

## 📌 Notes

* Projects are self-contained; external libraries are generally not required.
* Code is commented for readability and understanding.
* Some scripts follow strict **PEP8** formatting for best practices.
